        <p id="content-who"> Born and raised in Nova Scotia Canada, I have always loved two things. Spending my time outdoors and creating beautiful things. However, as someone living with <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder"><strong id="bpd">borderline personality disorder</a>.</strong> This disorder is widely misunderstood and difficult to treat. However, with time (<i>30+ years</i>) and research (<i>7 years obtaining an undergrad degree in psychology</i>), I am beginning to understand myself. **insert laugh**<br/>
        One of the biggest lessons I learned is that nature is healing. The only thing that consistently keeps me feeling grounded is being near nature. Since I am lucky enough to live in Nova Scotia I am abe to do this on a regular basis; I can spend time camping in the woods, kayaking on numerous lakes and rivers, hiking amazing seaside trails, or soaking in the sun at one of our amazing beaches.<br/>
        The other thing I learned is that being able to do what I love, while also keeping the lights on, was possibly a matter of life and death as far as my mental health was concerned. So I decided to learn skills that I could do anywhere I wanted to be. I can collect beautiful flowers, stones, and shells to work into a project; I can sit at a bench designing my next creation; I can paint or make charms on the weekends when I am visinting my family and things get quiet; or, I can write websites sitting by a river with no internet access (<i>like I'm doing right now</i>).</p>
    <a id="#why"><h3 id="why"> <u>What's the Point?</u></h3></a>
        <p id="content-why"> Mental health services, like all other health services in Nova scotia, are at a crisis point. I would like to be able to help those in need and donate $1 from the sale of each item to small organizations in Nova Scotia that offer mental health support in rural communities. While all donations raised will go towatds mental health organizations, you will be able to choose from a variety of organizations. Also, you will be able to see a daily update of donations so that you can watch the amount grow.</p>
